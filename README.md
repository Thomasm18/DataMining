# Data Mining for Sustainabiliy
For ESG funds, distinguishing between companies genuinely committed to sustainability and those
engaging in superficial greenwashing is critical. Current reporting inconsistencies make this task
challenging, leaving ESG funds reliant on incomplete or unstandardized data. This project tackles
these issues by focusing on two primary objectives:

1. Tracking Progress Toward Environmental Goals: Automate the extraction and analysis of
metrics such as Scope 1-3 emissions, green investments, and methane intensity from
annual reports.

3. Analyzing Impact of Financial Performance: Evaluate the relationship between financial
metrics (e.g., operating expenses, capital expenditures) and sustainability efforts to
understand the economic trade-offs.

By integrating automated text extraction, AI-driven sentiment analysis, and financial modeling, this approach bridges the gap between corporate claims and
measurable outcomes. The findings highlight the complex interplay between financial strategies and
sustainability goals, underscoring the need for standardized ESG reporting and independent audits
to ensure accountability.
