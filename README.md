# Data Mining for Sustainability
Can AI empower ESG funds to invest in companies truly committed to sustainability?

This was the driving question behind this project - Data Mining for Sustainability: Tracking Environmental Progress in the Oil and Gas Sector Using AI.

For ESG funds, distinguishing between companies genuinely committed to sustainability and those engaging in superficial greenwashing is critical. However, reporting inconsistencies often make this task challenging, leaving funds reliant on incomplete and unstandardized data.

Our project tackles this issue by:

1️⃣ Automating the extraction of relevant text from annual reports.

2️⃣ Using AI to identify key environmental metrics and evaluate corporate claims.

3️⃣ Employing financial modeling to explore the link between financial strategies and environmental progress.

The findings bridge the gap between corporate sustainability claims and measurable outcomes, emphasizing the urgent need for standardized ESG reporting and independent audits to ensure accountability and transparency.
